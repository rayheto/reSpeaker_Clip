}
```

### 7.4 Bookmark Format (marks.bin)

Binary format (little-endian):
```
[Header: 4 bytes magic "BMRK"]
[Count: 2 bytes uint16]
[Entry 1: 4 bytes uint32 - offset in seconds from session start]
[Entry 2: 4 bytes uint32]
...
```

### 7.5 Configuration Storage (Settings/NVS)

**DR-5.1**: All configuration stored in Zephyr settings subsystem (backed by LittleFS on external SPI flash)

**DR-5.2**: Settings file path: `/lfs/settings/run`

**DR-5.3**: NVS keys (5 total):

| Key | Settings Path | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|--------------|------|---------|-------------|
| mode | config/mode | uint8 | 0 (Normal) | Recording mode |
| noise_suppress | config/noise_suppress | uint8 | 15 | Noise suppression level (dB) |
| auto_delete_days | config/auto_delete_days | int8 | -1 (off) | Auto-delete policy |
| dereverb_enabled | config/dereverb_enabled | bool | false | Dereverberation enabled |
| oled_brightness | config/oled_brightness | uint8 | 128 | OLED brightness (0-255) |

## 8. Storage Capacity Planning

### 8.1 Bitrate and Storage

| Mode | Channels | Bitrate (total) | Storage per Hour | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Normal | Stereo | 32 kbps (16k x 2) | ~14.4 MB/hour | No DSP processing |
| Enhanced | Mono | 32 kbps | ~14.4 MB/hour | SpeexDSP noise suppress + dereverb |

Both modes produce approximately the same storage consumption (~14.4 MB/hour).

### 8.2 Capacity Examples

| SD Card Size | Recording Hours (approx) |
|-------------|------------------------|
| 1 GB | ~69 hours |
| 4 GB | ~278 hours |
| 8 GB | ~556 hours |
| 32 GB | ~2222 hours |

## 9. User Interface Requirements

### 9.1 Button Interaction Design

**UI-1.1**: Long press (> 1s): Toggle RTC streaming state (IDLE <-> RECORDING); starting requires a ready BLE File Data subscriber

**UI-1.2**: Short press (< 1s): Add bookmark (during recording)

**UI-1.3**: Button debounce: handled by custom GPIO input driver

**UI-1.4**: Haptic feedback on press confirmation (when haptic motor enabled)

### 9.2 OLED Screen Layout (88x48 pixels)

**UI-3.1**: Pairing guide screen: shown when BLE not bonded

**UI-3.2**: Recording screen: wave/dot animation with real-time audio energy visualization

**UI-3.3**: Paused screen: static paused indicator

**UI-3.4**: Status bar: battery level (24x24 icons with 0/25/50/75/100% + charging), connection status (BLE/WiFi/client), mode, OTA

**UI-3.5**: Power-off confirmation screen

**UI-3.6**: USB connected screen

**UI-3.7**: OTA update progress screen

**UI-3.8**: Low battery fullscreen warning (<10%)

### 9.3 Audio Visualization

**UI-4.1**: Recording display shows real-time audio energy level (0-10 scale)

**UI-4.2**: Energy history (13 samples) is packed into 7 bytes and sent via BLE every ~200ms

**UI-4.3**: Display animation uses fast bars (Enhanced mode) or slow dot (Normal mode)
