## Change History

### 2026-06-16 - v0.0.5 Release

- **Idle power: ~1.5mA → ~170µA (production)** via four changes, each measured on the 3V3 rail:
  - nRF5340 internal regulators switched to DCDC (`vregmain`/`vregradio` = `NRF5X_REG_MODE_DCDC`); ~500–600µA
  - SD card idle power-gating: after 45s of no record/transfer/AT/USB activity, unmount → disk deinit → SPI4 runtime-PM suspend → park CS low → LDO2 off; lazy remount on next access via `storage_ensure_mounted()`
  - SPI bias-pull-up removed from `spi3`/`spi4` (push-pull needs no pull-up) and `bias-pull-down` added to `spi4_sleep`; ~750µA
  - UART console keeps UARTE active at idle (~570µA, baud-independent); the `production` snippet disables console + UART log backend
- **Debug / production firmware split** via the `production` snippet: debug keeps UART console + SD log at INF; production strips both for low power. Both exported to `output/0.0.5/`
- **FS log backend (`/SD:/LOG`) now AT-controlled**: new `AT+LOG=off|info|debug` toggles it at runtime; boot default coupled to `LOG_BACKEND_UART` (debug on / production off) so the app-only Kconfig symbol is never broadcast into the mcuboot sysbuild image
- **Storage-full handling**: percentage-based (`CLIP_STORAGE_FULL_PERCENT`, default 95%) via `fs_statvfs`; recording refused with a "Storage Full" on-screen error and BLE event when SD is full
- **AT+NAME**: capacity 32B → 256B; surrounding quotes stripped from the argument
- **BLE reliability**: fixed slow-advertising interval (was a copy-paste of the fast interval); un-bonded devices also drop to slow advertising; connection params tightened (interval 15–30, supervision timeout 800); CCC handlers use a notify mask (`&`) instead of equality
- **Transfer cancel**: thread-safe, marks the transfer ERROR synchronously so re-download works after a BLE drop
- **Battery**: reserve capacity + early low-battery shutdown; SoC smoothing bypassed below reserve so a true low reading is acted on immediately
- **Python client (`tests/clip`)**: retries AT commands on BLE-notify drops; robust JSON parse around brace-matched notifications
- New storage API: `storage_idle_poweroff()` / `storage_resume()` / `storage_ensure_mounted()` / `storage_is_full()` / `storage_set_busy_cb()`

### 2026-05-18 - v0.0.1 Release

- Version reset to 0.0.1 for initial release
- SD card log persistence: LOG_BACKEND_FS writes WRN+ERR logs to /SD:/LOG/, 64KB files x10 max, circular overwrite
- USB CDC security: disabled by default, controlled via AT+USB command, auto-disables on USB disconnect
- BLE event notifications: state changes (recording/idle/paused), bookmark marks, BLE/WiFi/USB status events sent as JSON via GATT notify
- WiFi auto-off: 3 minute timeout (CONFIG_CLIP_WIFI_TIMEOUT_MS=180000), timer resets on client disconnect
- BLE security: LE Secure Connections pairing, encrypted link required
- Partition resize: mcuboot 96KB -> 84KB, app core slot0 940KB (268KB secure + 192KB non-secure + 256KB OTA slot + 192KB OTA non-secure)
- AT+NAME command: custom BLE device name, stored in NVS
- AT+USB command: enable/disable USB CDC, query status
- Memory: app core ~915KB FLASH, ~445KB RAM

### 2026-04-17 - UI Overhaul and Bug Fixes (v2.0.5)

- UI overhaul: 24x24 icons, 8x16 font, battery fix, charging display
- Low battery (<10%) full-screen display
- Disable idle BT/WiFi icons, add OTA icon, instant transfer display refresh
- Fuel gauge: nRF Fuel Gauge integration, SoC smoothing, charging status
- OTA progress display
- WiFi client connected icon
- Fix FILE_ACK NACK: skip CRC update on UDP send failure
- Fix AT+CANCEL race: cancel handled in transfer thread via volatile flag
- Fix AT+LIST sorting: sessions sorted newest-first with shared cache
- Fix DOWNLOAD response: add bytes field (use %u not %llu)
- Fix Ctrl+C in Python tools: gracefully merge downloaded files on interrupt
- Fix unexpected disconnect: merge files on disconnect/timeout
- Transfer file retry limit increased from 5 to 10

### 2026-03-28 - Documentation and Code Cleanup

### 2026-03-28 - Documentation and Code Cleanup
